      <li key={nanoid()} style={{ listStylePosition: 'inside' }}><Bold>Feature resolution.</Bold> During EIC building, overlapping and partially co-eluting features are retained as single features in the feature list. As a local minimum in the EIC trace might correspond to the valley between two adjacent, partially resolved peaks, the Local minimum resolver utilizes such minima to split &quot;shoulder&quot; LC peaks into individual features.</li>
      <li key={nanoid()} style={{ listStylePosition: 'inside' }}><Bold>13C isotope filter (isotope grouper).</Bold> Signals generated by isotopologues of the same chemical entity are detected as distinct features and included in the feature lists, representing redundant information for the downstream data analysis. This issue ordinarily occurs for C-containing molecules, where the 13C isotope signals can be easily detected. The 13C isotope filter module aims at filtering out the features corresponding to the 13C isotopes of the same analyte. The algorithm considers each feature individually and checks for the presence of potential 13C-related peak(s) in the feature lists.</li>
      <li key={nanoid()} style={{ listStylePosition: 'inside' }}><Bold>Feature alignment.</Bold> Feature alignment enables the alignment of corresponding features across all samples. The join aligner module aligns detected peaks in different samples through a match score. The score is calculated based on the mass and retention time of each peak and ranges of tolerance stipulated in the parameter setup dialog.</li>
      <li key={nanoid()} style={{ listStylePosition: 'inside' }}><Bold>Gap-filling.</Bold> The absence of features in some samples can either reflect the truth - the metabolite is absent in the given sample, or it can be due to data preprocessing. To account for this, gap filling is applied in this step. Gap-filling can be performed on the aligned feature lists to cope with missing features that might be artifacts of the feature-detection process.</li>
      <li key={nanoid()} style={{ listStylePosition: 'inside' }}><Bold>Spectral library search.</Bold> Spectral library search allows for the identification of metabolites by comparing the acquired spectra against a database of reference spectra. The reference spectra are obtained from the GNPS spectral library. During the search, the software compares the m/z values, retention times, and intensity patterns of the acquired spectra with those in the spectral library. A match score is assigned based on the similarity between the acquired spectrum and the reference spectrum. The higher the match score, the more likely the compound is present in the sample.</li>
